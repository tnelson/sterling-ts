# sterling-ts

```
yarn install
yarn run dev:forge ## Run in dev mode for forge (dev:alloy for Alloy)


## Now Sterling runs on localhost:8081

And add the forge server port as an arg (ex. localhost:8081/?62703)

```

### LOADING A MOCK TRACE
(Manual Datum -- + add manual datum in Sterling window)

## Maybe we want to respect layout or something? Or change layout (Theme vs Layout is tricky)
- RelationStylePanel.tsx
- `alloy-graph/srcnew` + `generateGraph.ts` is the new graph layout (and this is where the theme is applied)
