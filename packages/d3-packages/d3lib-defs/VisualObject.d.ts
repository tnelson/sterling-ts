/**
 * To anyone adding to this library in the future: please take the following steps when adding
 * new VisualObjects.
 *
 * 1. If the object is to be accessible within sterling, add it to library within ScriptViewImports.
 * 2. Add the name of the file, minus .d.ts, to the list within d3lib-def-compiler/src/D3LibDefCompiler.java.
 *    Make sure to add the name to the end of the list, following any files it imports.
 * 3. Run the typescript compiler ("tsc" in terminal) from within the d3-packages folder.
 * 4. Run the main method within D3LibDefCompiler.
 *
 * If these steps are not followed, the file's definitions will either not be accessible within
 * sterling, or will not show up in monaco.
